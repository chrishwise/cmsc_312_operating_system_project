# cmsc_312_operating_system_project
Project for CMSC 312

Phase 1:

I created classes for operation, process, and processes.
I used an object oriented approach to allow processes to be generated
I combined all of these classes into main.py

I tried to implement Round Robin but couldn't get it to fully work due to difficulties with setting burst time vs arrival time

Select the number of processes to generate: 
Select from available templates. Enter 1 or 2:

Processes are generated from xml template and then printed

Round robin is called to print but I have been struggling with getting it to work properly. Tried to implement it so that only critical sections need to be evaluated for scheduling.
